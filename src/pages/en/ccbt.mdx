## How is God using His Church to bring His word to the nations through bridge languages?

  

The work of the Global Church, which sends and supports missionaries to reach the nations in obedience to the great commission given by our Lord Jesus Christ, has resulted in the birth of multiple communities of believers even in the most remote places of the world. These communities have a longing need of the complete revelation of the Word of God in their own language. This need is not static; it continues to grow as new tribal churches report the need to complete Bible translations that could not be finished, update translations written in languages that have changed and evolved, and initiate translation projects in areas where the Church is established but still lacks the Bible in their own language.

### God's Call to the Tribal Church

God has given the tribal Church the desire and the calling to complete the work. However, a significant obstacle hinders their progress: the essential resources they need to be trained properly and to do the translation work are predominantly available in languages they do not understand or are restricted by copyright. This limited access severely hampers their ability to effectively carry out this crucial work.

### The Role of the Global Church

The Global Church has been called by God to serve the tribal Church by leveraging the technological resources of this age to make the necessary tools and training available for the tribal Church to undertake the task of translating the Word of God, and support them on their journey.

### The Church in Action

With this deep realization of the need, the obstacles, and the vision of a Church that matures as it understands the Word of God in the language of its heart, missionaries who dedicated their lives to God to take His Word to the nations, learning their culture and language, and understanding the challenges and responsibilities involved in the work of translation, decided to obey God's call. They opened and shared the knowledge and experience He gave them by His grace, by creating and providing resources and tools that are fully available to the Church. These resources can be freely translated into a language that the tribal Church can understand and used without restriction to resume the work they long to complete.

  

The Global Church is responding to this call, using the gifts God sovereignly distributed to each believer to help develop and freely deliver applications, guides, processes, and all necessary resources that facilitate the translation process for the tribal Church. This contributes to the growth and strengthening of the Church. Throughout this process, God has revealed new and creative ways for the Church to contribute and support the mission.

## IdiomasPuentes

IdiomasPuentes represents the Church equipping the Church to grow and mature in Christ. It is a convergence of churches, united by Godâ€™s call to support tribal churches by equipping them to translate the Word of God and bring discipleship and Bible study resources into the language of their heart.

### Focus areas

Collaboration and Unity: IdiomasPuentes thrives on the collaboration and unity among a network of Portuguese and Spanish-speaking churches to equip the tribal Church in Latin-American and Africa. These churches work hand-in-hand to fulfill God's mission, emphasizing the importance of partnership and mutual support. By leveraging each church's unique strengths and resources, they collectively advance the work of Bible translation and discipleship, embodying the principle that together, they can achieve far more than they could individually.

Empowerment through Resources: One of the core strengths of IdiomasPuentes is its commitment to providing free and open-license materials for Bible translation and discipleship. This includes essential tools such as software, manuals, guides, and dictionaries. These resources empower tribal churches, giving them the means to undertake the monumental task of translating the Bible into their native languages. By making these tools accessible, IdiomasPuentes removes barriers and enables communities to engage deeply with the Scriptures.

Cultural and Linguistic Relevance: IdiomasPuentes focuses on empowering the native Church to translate the Bible into their own languages by equipping them with essential tools and guides. These resources are crafted by missionaries with extensive experience in Bible translation across various native languages. The tools and guides provide an abstracted, accurate meaning of the original Bible text along with multiple general translation alternatives and suggestions. The native translators use their deep cultural knowledge to make the right translation decisions, ensuring that the translated message is culturally relevant and accurate.

Training and Support: Providing training and support is another crucial aspect of IdiomasPuentes' mission. They offer guidance to tribal churches throughout the translation process, utilizing technological resources to bridge gaps in understanding and access. This support system ensures that translators are well-equipped and confident in their ability to produce accurate and meaningful translations, fostering a sense of capability and empowerment.

Transformation and Growth: Ultimately, the work of IdiomasPuentes encourages spiritual growth and maturity within tribal communities by providing access to the Scriptures in their native languages. This deeper encounter with the Word of God transforms lives and communities, fostering a closer relationship with God. As churches engage with these resources, they experience a transformative journey that not only enhances their understanding of the Bible but also strengthens their faith and communal bonds.

  

IdiomasPuentes aims to harness the collective strength and resources of the Church to spread God's Word to every corner of the world, ensuring that all people can hear and understand the Gospel in their own language. They not only provide the tools but also connect churches to work together, fulfilling the Great Commission in a collaborative and supportive manner.

  

### Bible Translation Tools

#### The Challenge

Supporting the tribal Church in completing Bible translation involves equipping it with the proper training and tools to carry out faithful and reliable translations. Missionaries have produced a set of translation resources to guide the tribal Church and help them grow as translators and interpreters of God's living Word.

  

#### Bridge Texts

The Bridge Texts are two translation tools that allow tribal Church translators to closely examine the biblical text:

Literal Bridge Text

A literal translation of the Bible, designed as a tool for translation.

Brings translators closer to the structure and literal expressions used in the original languages (Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic).

Simple Bridge Text

A simplified translation of the Bible, designed as a tool for translation.

Helps translators understand the meaning behind the literal expressions, rhetorical figures, idioms, and difficult words.

  

#### Translation Notes

A set of notes written by missionaries and consultants to assist the translator throughout the translation process, verse by verse. These notes help in understanding the text and making a faithful, clear, and natural translation.

  

#### Translation Academy

A manual containing all the translation concepts needed for a faithful translation from the bridge language to the tribal language. Closely related to the translation notes, it provides necessary articles at the right moment.

  

#### Translation Words

A dictionary of specific key terms to which the translator must pay special attention. It offers definitions and guides the translator to find the appropriate translation in context.

  

#### Translation Questions

A tool containing questions to verify the naturalness and accuracy of the text. Useful for measuring the tribal Church's understanding of the final translation.

  

### Join the Mission

As the Church in Latin America and even Africa engages in Bible translation, they are transformed through a closer encounter with the Word. Using the tools and guides developed by missionaries, they understand and see things they never did before. Both the resource-generating Church and the using Church are growing, maturing, and acting as they hear God's voice in the language of their hearts.

We don't just provide tools; we connect Churches to fulfill God's call to spread the life-changing message of the Gospel worldwide. Join us in this important task and see how the Word of God can change hearts and lives.
